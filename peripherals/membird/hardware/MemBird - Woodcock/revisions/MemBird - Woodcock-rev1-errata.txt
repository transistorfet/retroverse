Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- the logic that drives BERR has a ringing that dips below the ON threshold causing a small blip in
  BERR, which could very well be interpreted as a failure.  It doesn't seem to be caught in time by
  the k30p, but it's definitely incorrect.  It's likely caused by the delay between the two inputs,
  which have to both be on at the same time in order for the request to be "valid" (ie. not BERR).
  This may not actually be the fault of this card though, as the CPU card is not delaying the
  assertion of AS until 35ns after the address and address mod signals become active
