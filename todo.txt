* for IVC-68k, use an io from the serial controller to swap ram and flash, so it can be used for ProcessorTests validation

* make a breakout board, which you can design now and use with the components on order, to connect a logic analyzer

* in order to prevent transceivers from driving the same outputs, you'd need a dual 2-4 decoder, some invertors, and maybe an or/and gate for taking into account direction

* make a mode that you can at least manually select, where an external device can write data to the local bus with the cpu suspended, either using the A24/D16 cycle or the A32/D32
  cycle.  The A40/MD32 cycle is not possible without additional latches for the address, unless... you can use a transparent bidirectional latch, there is 74ABT16646 but it's in a
  56-pin package, and requires a clock, which makes it less of a drop in replacement

* do you have to transfer data between parts of the data bus to interface the 68030 with the VME bus, in light of the fact that the upper most 8 bits is used to transfer 8 bit data?

* I need to figure out all the logic for the bus artibtrator, and for the CPU card.  I should have it mostly done early on so I know what signals will be needed

* should you use active or passive terminating resistors?  I saw somewhere that a backplane with passives draws 1.5A which is a lot, even though this will have its own power supply
* make an 8 socket backplane to start, 123mm by 178mm or something, which is not too expensive or big
* for the daisy chain lines, it would be nice to have a switch to bypass a socket, but there are 5 signals.  You can put a hex non-inverting 3 state buffers across each socket and
  have a single switch for each socket, preferrably a rocking dip switch that can be set with a screwdriver or pencil by reaching in the back.  That would add $1 a socket for the
  hex invertor, and >$2 for the a dual rocker-type dip switch (singles are $10 at digikey).  Single slide switches are $0.50 or so
* the nice thing is that you can put it on the board design, but not populate them, and it'll still work.  You just won't be able to skip slots.
* need to sort out power connector for the backplane, and power requirements
* you also need a bus arbitrator and interrupt controller, which I think I could make as a separate card that fits into a normal slot (but always slot 0).  It definitely shouldn't
  go on the CPU card.  I might need an ATF1508 or something to act as interrupt controller, so maybe I should make it a separate card so I can upgrade it.  It only needs a 3-row connector.
* make the footprints for the DIN sockets on the backplane have 5 rows, such that the middle 3 rows would be populated for standard 3U operation, the right most 4 rows would be
  for my extended version, where the signals from the P2 socket are on the right most row, or you could use all 5-rows with the VM64x connectors, where the reserved right most
  row would still be my extended non-standard version, but the right row of ground signals could be added, and the sockets could take either a 3 row or VME64x card instead of
  requiring a different physical socket the way the 4-row connectors need =/

* make sure to use hardcoded logic to prevent transceivers from writing into eachother because that can easily fry bits


* VME bus
* serial bus would be useful

* there is some question of the I/O space, which will be different anyways, so the drivers will have to use different addresses.  It would be nice if the RAM could more easily be
  variable in size.  This would be ok if you reserved all of 0x00800000 to 0x00FFFFFF for onboard SRAM, and the lower area for I/O and flash, with everything above 0x01000000
  being on the bus.  (actually I think the upper part of memory is the A16 and A24 address spaces, as part of the VME standard)
* where should the memory and I/O be mapped?  What if you had a bus that only used A24 space like VME allows? (ie. Z280 or something)


* could add a microcontroller that monitors power and halt and resets the CPU after a period if it's locked up, and possibly other functions.  It might not be easy to make it accessible
  to the CPU on the controller card, but it could possibly be hooked up to the serial bus and communicate with other peripherals



* !!! check on the VME board you have what the open collector outputs like IRQx and BRx are at, voltage-wise.  Since they're open collector, I would expect them to always float at
  logic 1, but I don't think the data and other signals are floating at logic 1 due to the terminating resistors on the bus, so who's supposed to drive them high?
* that might be what was meant about DTACK/RETRY/IACK being three stated *and also* open collector, ie. it only pulls up the signal to logic 1 when the current bus controller is
  requesting a transaction

IVC-STH7:

    * 25MHz osc (both ST reference boards use it)
    * 32kHz crystal optional (with 1.5pF caps)

    * ethernet
    * some I2C and SPI
    * a few UARTs
    * USB (OTG?)
    * maybe some headers for CAN, just because
    * SD Card slot, or eMMC
    * QSPI flash or SDRAM, like the discovery has? (no, not needed and uses too many pins)
    * LCD connector if it's not too many I/Os (probably is though)

    * after looking more closely at the schematic, which clearly labels which lines need to be length matched and differential, particularly for the ethernet and USB signals, I'm thinking
      maybe I shoud only use the full speed simple USB interface instead of the high speed phy chip since I know I can make FS work (ie. for the bootloader in Fidget), and the safety
      of USB working the first time is more important.  The Ethernet will be the experiment with a high speed PHY interface and differential signals

    * the ref schematic is using lots of 33 ohm resistors to suppress reflections on the what looks to be the transmission side of high speed traces, such as the ethernet MAC-to-PHY
      maybe you should put those on the ethernet chip, at least, just in case

    * should you replace the microUSB with USB-C?  I probably have a bunch of existing microUSB-B connectors, since I used that on fidget...
    * add one of those clip on grounded loops, so the oscilloscope probe can be connected


    * IACKIN, IACKOUT, [BG0IN - BG3IN], [BG0OUT - BG3OUT] signals can be driven directly and always have the same direction based on the pin function only
    * BBSY, BERR, DTACK are open collector and change direction based on whether this card is a controller or device at that moment. BBSY is from controller, DTACK and BERR are from the device

    * IACK, SYSRESET, [IRQ1 - IRQ7], and [BR0 - BR3] are all open collector, and effectively bidirectional, but all except SYSRESET are primarily outputs (for controller, don't cares for devices)

    * BCLR, SYSCLK, SERCLK,


    The VMEbus signal types are listed below:
    Open collector signals which require Open Collector drivers and receivers:
    ACFail, BBSY, BERR, DTACK, IACK, SERDAT, SYSFAIL, SYSRESET, [IRQ1 - IRQ7], and [BR0 - BR3].
    Three-State signals which require 3-State drivers and receivers:
    AS, DS0, DS1, DTACK, RETRY, IACK, LWORD, WRITE, [AM0 - AM5], [A01 - A31], and [D00 - D31].
    Totem-Pole signals which require Totem-Pole drivers and receivers:
    BCLR, SYSCLK, SERCLK, IACKIN, IACKOUT, [BG0IN - BG3IN], [BG0OUT - BG3OUT].
