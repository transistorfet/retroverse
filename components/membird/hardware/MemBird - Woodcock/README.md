MemBird - Woodcock
==================

Status: Build & Tested

Latest: Rev. 1

### About

A 16-bit VME memory card with 4MB of Static RAM at either 5V or 3.3V

It's named after the American Woodcock, a small, slow-walking bird, since this card
only has a small amount of memory, and will be slower to access, being only 16-bits.

They are very cute birds, with an adorable walk, and a funny call
