### About

A generic card with an STM32H7 microcontroller on it that interfaces to the VME bus using GPIO.
I had intended to use it as a bus analyzer, but it's a bit too slow for the k30p CPU at 12.5MHz.

A rainbow of others cards can just be seen behind the blue card: red, green, purle, and black from nearest to furthest.")
