* in order to prevent transceivers from driving the same outputs, you'd need a dual 2-4 decoder, some invertors, and maybe an or/and gate for taking into account direction

* make a mode that you can at least manually select, where an external device can write data to the local bus with the cpu suspended, either using the A24/D16 cycle or the A32/D32
  cycle.  The A40/MD32 cycle is not possible without additional latches for the address, unless... you can use a transparent bidirectional latch, there is 74ABT16646 but it's in a
  56-pin package, and requires a clock, which makes it less of a drop in replacement
