Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- the text on the chip is aligned so that pin 1 is in the lower left corner, but that is the top of
  the chip on the board, so the text is upside down but it's a minor issue

- the UART headers are oriented the wrong way, such that the extension boards I have face inward
  towards the main chip.  I have other header cables, but it should be fixed on the next revision 

- the transceiver OE and DIR inputs for the address and data bus are swapped between address and
  data, so AL_OE and AL_DIR control the lower data bus signals, and the DL_OE and DL_DIR signals
  control the lower address bus signals.  In this case, it really only affects the labels since
  each of those transceiver control signals are driven directly by I/Os.  It's a good thing in
  hindsight that I didn't try to combine them using function-specific assumptions that would have
  required a more substantial workaround, but it came at the expense of more I/Os 

- a minor improvement would have been to route all the 5V from the bus through a jumper so, which
  would have allowed current measurements of what's being drawn from the bus.  Same for the 3.3V
  regulator, to know what the load on the LDO is at any given time.

- it would have helped to have an I/O connected to 5V through a resistor, so it could use it as an
  analog input and assert the SYSRESET signal in software until the voltage is above the minimum
  of 4.85V

- the microSD card slot is backwards, so the card has be inserted from the board-side, instead of
  the being accessible through the slot opening. It's still possible to get the card in, but hard
  to get it out.  I haven't tried accessing it though, so I don't know if it works electrically
