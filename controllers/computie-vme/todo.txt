To Do for ComputieVME
=====================

- should you used 0603 caps for space saving?

- make a fully static design if possible, possibly removing the A40/MD32 cycle if it's too complex


- looking more into the other signals, DBEN doesn't look as valuable, because it mostly mirrors either AS or DS depending on a read or write
  but ECS might be valuable because it goes low before AS does, which could be used to request the bus and put the address information on the
  bus before the AS signal goes low (by one half clock)
- should you use the DBEN output or DS in the logic to control the data bus transceivers


- use AVEC to end an interrupt cycle
- use the serial controller's GPIO as flags to change the selected bus access type or just generally some kind of programmable hardware/register flag/switch, without needing the data bus on the PL



- do you need a phase locked loop to go even higher, to 100MHz? to drive the logic fast enough, or is it ok to go at a minimum of 3 clock cycles per operation
- You'll probably want a 50MHz clock, which you can convert either to a 25MHz clock, or just output it at 50MHz for the CPU, since the clock doesn't go directly to the CPU
