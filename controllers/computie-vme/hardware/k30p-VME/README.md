### About

A CPU card for a VME-based computer system using an MC68030 with some onboard RAM and Flash, and a
onboard serial ports with integrated FTDI Serial-to-USB controllers, and a programmable ATF1508
CPLD for glue logic.  The 'p' in the name stands for Programmable due to the CPLD.

Currently it's in development and I'm making slow progress with the CPLD, but I don't want to jump
further ahead until I'm sure I can make it work
