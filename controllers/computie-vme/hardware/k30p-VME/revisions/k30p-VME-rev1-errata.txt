Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- I put all the surface mount chips on first without programming the CPLD, and it caused almost 1.5A
  of current draw from the transceivers outputting into each other (very bad).  This also happens
  when programming the CPLD, because the /OE signals are active low, and when those outputs (driven
  by the CPLD) are high impedence during programming, it causes them to output into eachother again
  and get hot enough to burn my fingers.  I absolutely need to add logic to only enable one at a
  time, or pull the /OE signals high when not driven low.

- the JTAG connector labels are misleading and there's no pin 1 indicator, so it would be easy to
  connect it backwards

- inrush current is about 1.4A even though in only takes 100mA without the socketed chips.  Maybe
  you should add a 100 ohm resistor to limit the inrush, at least for select components

- the oscillator with a 50MHz crystal seems to be going at 16.666 MHz instead, and I think it's the
  15k resistor across the crystal.  I'm seeing 1M ohm or even higher used in a lot of places.  If I
  put a big resistor in parallel (which should actually reduce the resistance below 15k), it starts
  going at 50MHz, so it's definitely related to the resistor, but I'll have to play with sizes.  It
  turns out a 1K worked instead
