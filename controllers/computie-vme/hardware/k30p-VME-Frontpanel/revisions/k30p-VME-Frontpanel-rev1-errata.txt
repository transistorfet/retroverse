Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- the holes that connect to the board are slightly too far apart, so the panel has a tendency to bow
  outwards unless the holes are adjusted

- since I printed it in 1.6mm thick aluminum instead of 2mm thick like the VME spec uses, the
  alignment posts for the fixed handle that's part of the Schroff 20818018 3U 4HP frontpanel kit
  have to be filed down or else it will interfere with the metal bracket pieces and not lay flat
